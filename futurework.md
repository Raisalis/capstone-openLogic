# Future Work Notes

A quick list of things that could be improved.

- UI Design
  - Still using basic HTML buttons/text.
- JS code structure
  - Very disorganized, functions could be grouped better for coherency.
- Duplicated code
  - Utility functions would clean-up the code a lot.
- Minor Bug in Backend: Unfinished Proofs
  - Finished Proofs aren't actually removed from the Unfinished Proof list. Minor because a student that has completed the proof will still be labeled as having completed it.
  - Solution: Update record keeping in backend for tracking when a proof is finished. There's too little tracking at the moment to account for unfinished vs finished and removal from dropdown.
