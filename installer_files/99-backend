# This file is used to provide status updates during SSH login
# In particular, it displays the status of the last deployment
# for both the "live" and "dev" branches, and the status of the
# backend services.

# IMPORTANT:
# This script must never return a 'negative' exit code, else
# the motd will not include it. For simplicity, I've made use
# of '|| true' after external commands and at the script end.

# Install path: /etc/update-motd.d/99-backend
